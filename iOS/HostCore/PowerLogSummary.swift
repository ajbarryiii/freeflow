/// samples belongs to the first sample's state, because a sample is taken at every transition.
///
/// - Within a process run, durations come from the monotonic clock, so wall-clock changes do not
///   distort them. A new run starts at a `launch` row, or wherever uptime or cumulative CPU time goes
///   backwards (a launch row lost with a killed process's buffer).
/// - An interval is **inactive** (the "LocalFlow inactive" baseline) when the process was suspended or
///   not running: it starts at a `terminate` row, or in the background with no session, where nothing
///   keeps the app running. Across runs its length comes from wall time; a negative one is dropped.
/// - An interval is **unknown**, and counted nowhere else, when an awake state went unsampled for
///   longer than `maxAwakeInterval` (the 60 s timer did not fire, so the app was not really awake), or
///   when a run ended unannounced in an awake state (a crash or jetsam, with unknown timing).
/// - Drain figures use only intervals that are unplugged at both ends, with known levels, and with no
///   level rise (a rise means it charged in between). For a gap that is all the endpoints can show.
/// - There is no projection of microphone cost: see `observedDrainNote`.
