/// The power log's one serialized owner (test builds only; ARCHITECTURE.md, "Power log"). Buffering,
/// encoding, rotation, writes, reads for the summary, export copies and Clear all run in order on one
/// utility queue, never on the caller's thread:
///
/// - A snapshot sees disk plus buffer at one point in that order, so no row is counted twice. An append
///   is all or nothing (`PowerLogFiles`); if one cannot even be undone, its rows are dropped and counted
///   rather than kept for a retry that would write them twice.
/// - Each snapshot carries the generation it was read at. A Clear that deleted anything advances the
///   generation, and `isCurrent` is false while a Clear is pending, so a read already in flight never
///   brings deleted data back. A Clear that deleted nothing reports `.failed` and changes nothing.
/// - After a failed write the rows stay buffered for the next flush, but only the newest
///   `maxBufferedSamples`; older rows are dropped and counted.
/// - An export copies disk plus buffer into a fresh directory that nothing writes again, then flushes;
///   whatever the flush does, the export is complete or refused.
