/// outside changes and hiding while one settles), focus changes between two fields (keys typed before
/// the new field's first callback, fingers held across), fields without an identity (fingers held
/// through nil → A → B), hiding, the host app's own edits, caret moves and selections, against hosts with
/// lagging adjustments, short, long or missing callbacks, WebKit's double reports and proxy contexts that
/// lag the keyboard's edits. Documents are compared as UTF-16 code units, as UIKit keeps them.

/// The oracle computes the expected documents, carets, selections, shift and layer from the script
/// alone, with its own statement of the contract's rules (`OracleRules`, `OracleTyping`): a key edits the
/// field the proxy serves the moment it is released (a held key is committed in press order when
/// another touches down), with the shift and layer of that moment, unless it was pressed in another
/// identified field; casing and the double-space period follow the text before the caret. Every edit is
/// checked right after its release. A gesture whose target the script knows (a whole-context field, a
/// span of one-unit characters) lands exactly there, keys at its lift included. For a free gesture a key
/// interrupted, only where the first key acts comes from the host (its caret once what the gesture issued
/// has landed, inside a cluster too: the accepted residual); the shift there follows what the keyboard can
/// read (the gesture's landing, or the proxy when a probe's outcome is abandoned), and every key is
/// checked exactly, case included. A gesture no key interrupted ends on a character boundary, with the
/// text unchanged but for an outside change. Every step that needs the keyboard settled fails when it
