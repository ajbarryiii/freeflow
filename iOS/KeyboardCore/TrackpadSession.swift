/// One trackpad gesture over the text the proxy exposes, modeled on Apple's floating cursor
/// (ARCHITECTURE.md, "Measured Apple keyboard behavior"). A 2D point starts at the caret in the
/// layout of the context snapshot and moves by the measured per-event gain. The caret is the
/// character boundary nearest the point on the line whose center is nearest the point's y. Line ends
/// do not wrap; only vertical motion changes lines; the point is clamped and overshoot is forgotten.
///
/// The keyboard feeds it touch events and, once per display frame, what the proxy reports; it
/// answers with at most one offset for `adjustTextPosition(byCharacterOffset:)`. Pure, so the loop
/// is tested against a simulated host.
///
/// The proxy shows only a window of text around the caret (in UIKit, a sentence or two before it,
/// often starting mid-line, and after it up to the end of the sentence or line), and its context
/// updates after an adjustment at once or a little later. So the caret moves virtually inside a
/// snapshot. The snapshot is refreshed when the caret reaches its edge and the host shows more, and
/// the point is re-anchored to the caret's line. A line beyond the window is reached by one jump
/// past the snapshot's edge; at the document's edge the host ignores such an offset, so the caret
/// stays put. Columns are real only on lines whose start the snapshot shows: when a vertical move
/// lands the caret on a line whose start is hidden and the host then shows more of it, the snapshot
/// is refreshed and the point keeps its column.
///
/// The point is the intended target and is kept apart from how the caret gets there (probes, a
/// walk to the snapshot's edge, refreshed snapshots). After the finger lifts the point stays where it
/// was, and settling keeps re-anchoring and snapping it until the caret is there.
///
/// Safety rules (ARCHITECTURE.md, "Trackpad safety", "Undo ownership v2", "Probes only where units
/// can differ"):
/// - Moves across single-code-point BMP characters need no probe: both units count them alike.
///   Only crossing a multi-unit cluster with the unit unknown probes, by the cluster's UTF-16 length
///   (or the crossing-side scalar when the snapshot has too few clusters, never mid-pair).
/// - Each adjustment carries a consumable expectation: where it should leave the caret. A host
///   callback counts as the gesture's own only if it matches one (`acknowledge`); anything else is
///   an outside change, and the keyboard ends the gesture. Reports arrive in order: those still owed
///   by earlier adjustments (or an earlier gesture) are attributed first. An expectation not reported
///   within `syncTimeout` is retired; one reported only as issued then leaves the session ambiguous,
///   and the keyboard ends it. Time never makes a callback the gesture's own.
/// - A probe is read only once its callback matched, or after the timeout: the proxy's immediate
///   answer is provisional. Its outcome is placed through overlapping local anchors; the unit is
///   learned only when exactly one unit explains it. An outcome inside a cluster is completed (or,
///   after cancellation, rolled back) to a real boundary; one that cannot be placed is rolled back
///   to where the probe started. A caret left inside a cluster is always repaired, unless a key ended
///   the gesture first (the accepted residual).
/// - A context that shows the caret exactly at the snapshot's edge is never read as a crossing. An
///   unchanged context after an edge probe is ambiguous (an ignored step at the document's edge looks
///   like a move between blank lines), never a boundary. Further probes need new finger travel;
///   after `maximumAmbiguousProbes` the edge holds, and new travel past it allows one more at a time.
/// - Probes whose outcome could not be placed are retried at most `automaticProbeRetries` times
///   without new finger travel. A probe the host verifiably ignored (a grapheme host asked to step
///   past the text) is retried with the smallest step.
/// - Outcomes with unknowns (a jump past the snapshot's edge) need affirmative evidence: an emptied
///   field matches nothing. A `selectionDidChange` fits only an adjustment still owed a callback.
/// - Cancellation (and hiding) drops the snapshot, its laid-out copy and every expected context at
///   once, rolls an outstanding probe back, and watches an outstanding jump past the edge until its
///   time limit, moving a caret it left inside a hidden cluster back to the cluster's edge.
/// - A key ends the session on the spot (ARCHITECTURE.md, "Typing model v2"): nothing more is issued
///   and a probe's outcome is abandoned. Typing never waits on any of this.
/// - An outside change ends the gesture without another step toward the target, but a caret that may
///   be inside a cluster (something out, or the field shows it there) is watched and repaired to a
///   whole-cluster boundary for at most twice `syncTimeout`, unless a key comes first (`abortGuarding`).
/// - The snapshot is never taken again from a context that does not show the caret where the session
///   put it: an adjustment has not landed yet.
/// The keyboard re-validates the field and the edit generation before every adjustment.
