/// "Undo last dictation" (ARCHITECTURE.md, "Undo ownership v2"): whether it may be offered, and how
/// to carry it out. Ownership is proven by anchors, never by timing. Pure.
///
/// - **Anchors.** At insertion: up to `anchorLength` characters of the context before the caret
///   (read before inserting) and up to `anchorLength` after it.
/// - **Proof.** The after-context must start with the after-anchor, as far as both are visible. The
///   before-context must end with the before-anchor followed by the insertion; if the context is
///   truncated, its visible part may instead be a suffix of the insertion at least
///   `minimumVisibleSuffix` characters long, and deletion then proceeds progressively, re-verifying
///   continuity each step. Shorter insertions, such as a lone "\n", need both anchors in full; with an
///   empty document, the exact whole context. Both ends of what is deleted must be character
///   boundaries in the current context, so a deletion never takes a neighbouring character the
///   insertion merged with ("\r" + "\n", a letter + a combining mark).
/// - **Attribution.** None here: no callback ever counts as this undo's (ARCHITECTURE.md, "Typing
///   model v2": Undo is unchanged and fails closed). UIKit sends none for `insertText` or `deleteBackward`, so none is
///   owed; any callback that is not a pending trackpad adjustment's ends the undo for good (the owner,
///   `EditingCore`, invalidates it), our own edits' reports included. A host that edits without
///   callbacks is a residual risk the anchors mitigate.
/// - **No proof, no Undo.**
/// - **Lifetime.** The text and anchors are held in memory for at most `window` and dropped on
///   invalidation.
