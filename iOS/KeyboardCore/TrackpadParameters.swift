///   the finger is then within 16 pt (straight line) of its touch-down point. Movement before
///   activation is discarded.
/// - Gain depends only on the finger's 2D step per delivered touch event, s = |Δ|, the same on both
///   axes and in both directions, independent of the time between events (confirmed on device):
///   g = 1 + 0.04·s² up to 2 pt, then 1.16 + 0.16·(s − 2) up to 5.92 pt, then 1.787·(s/5.92)^0.389.
