/// The keyboard's editing side without UIKit (ARCHITECTURE.md, "Typing model v2: immediate
/// execution"): keys, the held delete key's deletions, dictated text and its undo, the trackpad and
/// host callbacks. `KeyboardInput` adapts it to the key area, the text proxy and timers; tests drive it
/// with a fake document.
///
/// - **Immediate execution.** A key edits through the proxy the moment it is typed (released), as on
///   every other iOS keyboard, with the shift and layer in effect then. Nothing is queued, delayed or
///   batched; the proxy applies edits in the order they are issued, so hiding loses nothing typed.
/// - **The trackpad never delays a key.** A key ends any gesture on the spot (`TrackpadController
///   .interrupt`): nothing more is adjusted, and a probe's outcome is abandoned. A key typed exactly as a
///   probe crosses a cluster may land inside it (the accepted residual).
/// - **Field binding.** A key goes to the field current when it is typed. It is cancelled only when
///   the field it was pressed in and the current one are both identified and differ; a missing
///   identity never blocks it. A field the proxy serves before its first callback is adopted first, so
///   the key is cased from that field's text.
/// - **Shift and double space.** Every host callback that is not a recognized echo of our own edits (or
///   of the gesture's own adjustments) starts the space and shift timing over and derives the shift from
///   the text again.
/// - **Own edits** are recorded (`EditingCore.recordOwnEdit`), so their echoes never count as outside
///   changes, while Undo fails closed.
/// - **The text before the caret** is the proxy's, or the typing tail's while the proxy has not shown
///   our edits or the gesture's landing yet (`ContextTail`). The proxy can show an own edit late and
///   with no callback, so for `contextWatch` after each one the shift follows it every frame.
/// Context is read in memory only; the typing tail is dropped on hiding.
